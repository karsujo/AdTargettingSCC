##Description
Social Media Networks are used to describe the relationship between various entities on a social media platform. These networks typically leverage graph theory and properties of graphs to gain some insight into the kinds of relationships modeled. In this project, I aim to explore a particular property of such graphs called strongly connected components, and apply this concept to a common problem in social media networks : Advertisement targeting (Community
detection).

##Instructions
To run the program, make sure python3 is installed, then go to the directory containing the SCC_SMN.py file and execute the command (in terminal):


`python3 SCC_SMN.py`

##Output

**Note: The input graph is fixed and the adjacency list is hardcoded into the program, according to the graph depicted in the report.**
